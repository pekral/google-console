## Class Structure
- Create custom exceptions when necessary.
- Use typed properties, not docblocks.
- Constructor property promotion when all properties can be promoted.
- Always mark new classes as final
- Set method and class names as camel case

## Single Responsibility
- Each function should do exactly one thing
- Functions should be small and focused
- If a function needs a comment to explain what it does, it should be split

## Clean Structure
- Keep related code together
- Organize code in a logical hierarchy
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions

## Encapsulation
- Hide implementation details
- Expose clear interfaces
- Move nested conditionals into well-named functions
